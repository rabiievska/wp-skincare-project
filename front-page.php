      <p>Hi there!</p>
      <p>My name is Tania, I am 33 years old and I am skincare addicted.</p>
      <p>I have a combination, akne-prone skin with a lot of dark freckles. During whole my life my skin was dehydrated and dull, with huge clogged pores and extreme oiliness 
        in the T-zone. It had constant breakouts, lack of elasticity, noticeable wrinkles between the eyebrows, flaking, a feeling of dryness and tightness.</p>
      <p>At the time, I knew nothing about skincare. For a long time, the only products I used were makeup remover milk and cleansing gel. After 25, 
        I bought my first full skincare, which included toner, day and night cream, and eye cream. </p>
      <p>I chose cheap and low-quality cosmetics with strong perfume, which made me gasp. Such experiments did not bring any results and after a year or so I 
        switched to professional cosmetics.</p>
      <p>My care consisted then of a salicylic acid cleansing gel, a restorative night cream, and a light cream fluid, which I used as a day cream.</p>
      <p>Using these products greatly improved the condition of my skin, although it did not solve the problems I had.</p>
      <p>After I moved to Berlin in 2016, the condition of my skin deteriorated significantly. It was getting worse every day. At that time I continued to use Ukrainian 
        professional care cosmetics, started taking vitamins and supplements designed for the skin. But nothing helped.</p>
      <p>Around this time period I learned about AHA and BHA acids from my friend. Then I bought Bioderma SÃ©bium
        Night Peel and was amazed by the results. Pores narrowed and cleared up, breakouts became very rare, and my skin tone improved.</p>
      <p>It became a point of reference. And I slowly began to learn about skincare, the ingredients, their combinations, what's useful and what's best to avoid.</p>
      <p>Since then, I have read hundreds of articles and studies, tested about a thousand different care products and identified my favorite brands and products and 
        deduced the perfect formula for me.</p>
      <p>Thanks to this I have been able to improve my skin significantly. Of course, it is still far from perfect, but I don't give up and keep going.</p>

      <h2>What has improved so far:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Freckles became very light and barely noticeable</li>
        <li>Breakouts are very rare. Mostly they appear in hot weather and after eating unhealthy or sugary foods</li>
        <li>My skin became evenly and beautifully colored and had a healthy glow</li>
        <li>The pores in the T-zone have narrowed and cleared up. If before, after a professional cosmetic facial cleansing, 
          my pores would become completely clogged after three days, now they remain clear for 2 to 4 weeks.</li>
        <li>Improved skin elasticity and firmness</li>
        <li>Thin, shallow wrinkles smoothed out or disappeared completely, and deeper ones stopped progressing</li>
        <li>The skin type is given by nature and cannot be changed, but among the improvements I can note that the sebum secretion 
          in the T-zone has slightly decreased and its quality has improved. While previously sebum was thick and sticky and felt very 
          heavy on the skin, now its texture is thinner, lighter and more fluid.</li>
      </ul>
